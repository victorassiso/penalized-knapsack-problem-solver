# Penalized Knapsack Problem Solver

## Overview

This project aims to solve the Penalized Knapsack Problem using simulated annealing and clustering search techniques. The Penalized Knapsack Problem is an extension of the classic Knapsack Problem, where each item not included in the knapsack incurs a penalty. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack while considering penalties for leaving items out.

## Problem Statement

Given a set of items, each with a weight, a value, and a penalty for exclusion, find the optimal combination of items to maximize the total value within a given knapsack capacity.

## Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It starts with an initial solution and iteratively explores neighboring solutions. The algorithm probabilistically accepts worse solutions to escape local optima. Over time, the probability of accepting worse solutions decreases, allowing the algorithm to converge toward an optimal solution.

In the context of the Penalized Knapsack Problem, simulated annealing can be applied by considering different combinations of items, accepting suboptimal solutions with penalties, and gradually refining the selection to improve the overall value.

## Clustering Search

Clustering search is a heuristic optimization technique that mimics the behavior of clustering in nature. It involves grouping solutions into clusters and exploring the search space within these clusters. This helps to efficiently navigate through the solution space and discover promising regions.

For the Penalized Knapsack Problem, clustering search can be employed to group combinations of items based on their similarities. By exploring within these clusters, the algorithm can focus on regions of the solution space likely to contain high-value solutions, thereby improving efficiency.
